# Ideal-Magnetic-Resonance-Scatterers-in-the-Visible-Range
We show that a non-magnetic silicon nanoparticle dimer can act as a pure magnetic scatterer in visible light under plane-wave illumination, with dominant magnetic resonance and suppressed electric dipole responses, achieved by spectrally overlapping the magnetic dipole resonance with electric toroidal and magnetic quadrupole modes.
